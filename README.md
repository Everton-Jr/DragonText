# DragonText
DragonText is a Text based Survival/RPG game created in C++ language. It's a game which I made for studying the language.

## How do I run it?
I don't know yet, the game is made on Visual Studio 2022 and, for tests, I run in the IDE debbuger.

_Note: the debugger is x64_

## Objective
Your objective is killing the **dragon** which is a very powerful creature in the game. So you need to become stronger, get better items and get lucky to do so.
